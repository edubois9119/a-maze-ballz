# Build instructions:

* Navigate to https://github.com/edubois9119/a-maze-ballz
* Click on the green "Clone or download button" and copy the SSH key. 
* Clone the a-maze-ballz project to your machine using IntelliJ's Check out from Version Control/Git
command (in the welcome screen), or the New/Project from Version Control/Git command (in the
workspace). This is an Android project, so please do not open it immediately after cloning!
* Instead, import the project you just cloned. In the Import Project window, select Import project
from external model and then the Gradle item in the list.
* After the project is imported add a run configuration. This should use the Android App
configuration, with a Name of "app", and with app selected from the Module pull-down control.
* Lastly, run the app by clicking the run button (green play button).
