# Basic User Instructions

Welcome to A-Maze-Ballz!

Once you've launched the app, you will be asked to sign in with your google account.

Following sign in, you will see a screen with 15 levels on it. 
Choose a level to play. The higher the number, the harder the maze.

When the maze loads, your objective is to move the ball through the maze. You can do so using the 
default tilt movement or you can select touch movement instead using the preferences screen in the
options menu. 

You will notice that the stopwatch starts as soon as the maze loads and will keep track of the time
it takes you to solve the maze. If you need to pause the maze for any reason, you may do so with the
pause button. This will freeze the ball until you decide to resume. 

If you would like to choose another maze before completing the one you've chosen, you 
may use the back button (at bottom of screen) to return to the level select page. 

Once you've completed the maze, you will have the option to select another maze or view your current
stats.

You can repeat these steps as many times are you'd like. 

At any point you may also choose to sign out of the app. Do this by accessing the options menu and 
clicking sign out.

Enjoy!
