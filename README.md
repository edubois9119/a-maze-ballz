## Overview
This app is a game that requires the user to navigate a ball through a maze. In order to move the 
ball through the maze, the user will have the option to tilt the device or drag the ball on the screen.
There are various levels of difficulty for the user to choose from.  

I chose this project because I love mazes and puzzles. I am a logic-orientated problem solver and 
wanted to create an app that I would enjoy using. I was also interested in learning how to implement
the use of the device's gyroscope for this app. I feel this app provides a fun and interesting 
set of challenges for it's user.   


## Intended Users
* People who travel and desire mobile apps that can be played around the world.
* Gamers who desire apps that save their game status/completion and allow them to compete 
independently or with other user around the globe.

## Current State of the App

* Currently the app functions almost as expected. The app uses google sign-in appropriately before 
allowing a user to access the app. When the user chooses a level to appropriate maze is loaded. When
the user completes the maze, they are directed to the completion page, where they can then choose
the next level to play. 

Currently the amount of time taken by the user to complete the maze is not functioning. Therefore the 
time taken to complete the maze is being put into the database.
