## Overview
This app is a game that requires the user to navigate a ball through a maze. In order to move the 
ball through the maze, the user will have the option to tilt the device or drag the ball on the screen.
There are various levels of difficulty for the user to choose from.  

I chose this project because I love mazes and puzzles. I am a logic-orientated problem solver and 
wanted to create an app that I would enjoy using. I was also interested in learning how to implement
the use of the device's gyroscope for this app. I feel this app provides a fun and interesting 
set of challenges for it's user.   

## Intended Users
* People who travel and desire mobile apps that can be played around the world.
* Gamers who desire apps that save their game status/completion and allow them to compete 
independently or with other user around the globe.
