## Intro

## Overview
This app is a game that requires the user to navigate a ball through a maze. In order to move the 
ball, the user will have to tilt the device, rather than using the touch screen. There are various
levels of difficulty for the user to choose from.  The mazes will be constructed using images pulled
from a google search.


## Intended Users
* People who travel and desire mobile apps that can be played around the world.
* Gamers who desire apps that save their game status/completion and allow them to compete 
independently or with other user around the globe.
